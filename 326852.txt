OVERVIEW
 
The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provided support to the USGS to work with  Haitian  partner agencies to improve earthquake monitoring in Haiti. The USGS seeks to establish a cooperative agreement with the Faculté Des Sciences, Université d'État d'Haïti, Port-au-Prince, Haïti, hereinafter "Recipient". Under this OFDA agreement, the Faculté
Des Sciences, Université d'État d'Haïti will install low-cost sensors and integrate the new data streams to strengthen Haiti's fledgling monitoring system and improve earthquake monitoring and reportng. 

RECIPIENT AND USGS INVOLVEMENT

The Recipient will undertake fieldwork to install new instruments and maintain existing instruments; collaborate with USGS researchers on installations and data integration; share results with all scientists involved with the project, and with Haitian partners; and contribute to publication of technical reports. 

There will be substantial United States Geological Survey (USGS) involvement in this project. The USGS will collaborate and participate in research, technical assistance, and product review/quality assurance throughout the performance period of the project.  The USGS will contribute to written reports for US and international partner agencies, and technical reports for outside publication.  

SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS
Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award.  The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable.

In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria:

Unsolicited Proposal – The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives;

Continuation – The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity;

Legislative intent – The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress’ intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose;

Unique Qualifications – The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications;
Emergencies – Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed.

Cooperative Agreements - USGS Unique Authority cited at 43 U.S.C. 36d (Federal, State, and academic partners) or DOI Authority cited at 43 U.S.C. 1457b (not-for-profit organizations).

Single Source Justification Description

USGS did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: 

 (4) Unique Qualifications – Installing and operating seismic monitoring equipment in Haiti requires specialized expertise and familiarity with the country.  To be successful, it is moreover imperative that the project be integrated with continuing seismic monitoring projects in Haiti.  In recent years, the Recipient has established a successful local program to augment the conventional monitoring network using low-cost instrumentation, partnering with the local governmental organization that operates the national network.  Because the security situation in Haiti makes it impossible for USGS personnel to travel to Haiti, it is not possible for the USGS to fulfill its signed contractual agreement with OFDA without partnering with a local Haitian agency. USGS support will contribute to an ongoing program established by Recipient to improve earthquake monitoring in Haiti.


(6) Cooperative Agreements - USGS Unique Authority cited at 43 U.S.C. 36d (Federal, State, and academic partners).
